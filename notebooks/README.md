For Day 4, there are a few additions that I would like to add in the future:

- Improve the forward model (interpolation scheme)
- Make a corner plot for a few stellar parameter inferences
- Analyzing the autocorrelation of the MCMC chain (convergence criteria)
- Look at the inferred stellar parameter uncertainties with position in the CMD.
